API methods could be called from web and from ansible,
so some things should be done in different ways. Also it's painful to fetch or calc some common
things in every API method to pass it down in call stack, So it's better off to get and keep them
here during WSGI call or Ansible run

Implemented as singleton module, just `import ctx from cm.api_context` and use `ctx.*` when needed
